This is a compilation of individual console commands that can be run at once if placed inside Skyrim folder. They will set all skills to 100. They will unlock every perk in the game (inculding vampire/werewolf etc) This will also set player level to 85 and health/magicka/stamina to 500. This script is meant to be ran at the start of a new save, to skip tedious leveling.


1. Place max.txt inside skyrim folder.
2. Create new Skyrim save. Open console.
3. Send command "bat max"
4. Profit.
